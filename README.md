The project hosted on GitHub represents only the main component and does not include all the libraries required to build and run the full solution. All related projects that make up the complete solution are maintained on GitLab. To retrieve the full solution, please use the script provided below. This process requires creating a GitLab account and generating a Personal Access Token with the read_repository permission.

Full functionality of the web app also depends on connecting to its corresponding database, which is not provided in this repository. You will need to configure and supply the appropriate database instance separately to enable complete operation.
